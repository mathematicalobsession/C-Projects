Prompt:
A common year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, Earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:
1) The year must be divisible by 4
2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400; therefore, both 1700 and 1800 are not leap years
Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
Write a program that takes in a year and determines the number of days in February for that year.
Ex: If the input is:
1712
the output is:
1712 has 29 days in February.  
Ex: If the input is:
1913
the output is:
1913 has 28 days in February.
Your program must define and call the following function. The function should return the number of days in February for the input year.
int DaysInFeb (int userYear)

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h> //true or false logic 

// didnt we already do something similar to this a few weeks ago???
// the function revieves 

// recieves a year and return the number of days in feb 


// not how the function is defined before the main function. This is so the main function can call it.
int DaysInFeb(int userYear) {
   // assume its not a leap year until we check 

   bool isLeapYear=false;

   // % gives the remainder. A remainder of 0 means it divides evenly 
   if (userYear % 400 == 0) {
      isLeapYear = true; //Years like 2000 ARE leap years 
   }
else if (userYear % 100 == 0) {
   isLeapYear = false; // years like 1900 are NOT leap years. 
}
else if (userYear % 4 == 0 ) {
   isLeapYear = true; // years like 2024 are leap year 
}
// If isLeapYear is true send back 
if (isLeapYear) {
   return 29;
}
else{
   return 28;
}

   
} //end of DaysInFeb
int main(void) {

int year; // stores the user's year 
int days; //stores the answer: 28 or 29 

// read the year the user types 
scanf("%d", &year);

// Ask our function how many days February has that year 
days = DaysInFeb(year);
// print the year and the number of days. 
printf("%d has %d days in February.\n", year, days);

return 0;
}
